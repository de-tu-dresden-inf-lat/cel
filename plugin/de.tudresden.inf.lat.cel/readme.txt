How to compile this project
---------------------------

In order to compile this project, the following technologies are suggested:

  * Development environment:
    Eclipse 3.5.0
    http://www.eclipse.org

  * Compiler :
    Sun Java Development Kit 6
    http://java.sun.com

  * Build tool :
    Apache Ant 1.7.1
    http://ant.apache.org

Once Java and Apache Ant are installed, it is enough to write "ant" in the main 
directory. Apache Ant reads the "build.xml" file and builds the project.

The plug-in jar will be generated in "dist/bundle".

The directories have the following structure.

  Source directories: (src)
    * src/conf : configuration files for the plug-in
    * src/doc : text for the javadocs
    * src/img/native : compiled version of CEL
    * src/main : source code of the main part
    * src/manifest : the manifest.mf file
    * src/test : source code of the unit tests

  Library directories: (lib)
    * lib : libraries that are included in the bundle

  Generated directories: (dist)      
    * dist/bin : compiled classes
    * dist/javadoc : generated javadocs
    * dist/lib : generated jar file
    * dist/report : generated reports of unit tests
    * dist/test : compiled unit test classes
